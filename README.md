# Plasticity-Driven-Spiking-Neural-Network
## Abstract — 
This study explores the optimization of SNNs using GAs to address the MC problem, a benchmark challenge in RL. The focus is on how GAs can navigate the high-dimensional parameter space of SNNs, enhancing their learning efficiency and adaptability. Employing a meta-optimization approach, L2L, the study systematically adjusts SNN parameters, demonstrating the potential of combining GA with biologically-inspired neural models. Additionally, the incorporation of synaptic plasticity into SNNs represents a significant advancement, aiming to capture more accurately the dynamic nature of biological learning processes. Through experiments, this study showcases the effectiveness of optimized SNNs, both static and plastic, in solving the MC problem, emphasizing the importance of synaptic plasticity. The results highlight the feasibility and benefits of using SNNs and GAs in complex ML tasks, opening new avenues for the development of adaptive and efficient computational models.
